### [Project 1: NeuralBee - A Saas product]

- Developed an innovative NeuralBee project that utilizes generative AI techniques to convert textual descriptions into fully functional websites.
- Implemented natural language processing (NLP) algorithms to extract critical information from the input text and generate HTML and CSS code accordingly.
- Enabled users to provide textual descriptions and receive dynamically generated websites as output, reducing manual web development efforts.

### [Project 2: AutoML - Simplifying Data Science Workflow](repo will be uploaded soon)

- Created an AutoML (Automated Machine Learning) tool specifically designed for data science students to automate repetitive tasks in the data science workflow.
- Implemented data exploration techniques using Pandas and NumPy to analyze datasets and provide insights about data quality, missing values, and statistical summaries.
- Developed data profiling algorithms to automatically identify the data types, distributions, and correlations within the dataset.
- Enabled users to generate basic visualizations and gain initial insights into the dataset, saving time and effort in manual exploratory data analysis.

### [Project 3: House Price Prediction in Mumbai](https://github.com/mahirbarot/ai_mumbai)

- Created a machine learning model to predict house prices in Mumbai based on various features such as location, size, amenities, and property type.
- Collected and preprocessed a dataset containing historical property data, considering data cleaning, feature engineering, and outlier removal factors.
- Utilized regression algorithms, including linear regression, decision trees, and ensemble methods, to train and evaluate the predictive models.
- Employed libraries like Scikit-learn and Pandas for data manipulation, feature selection, and model evaluation.
- Achieved accurate predictions and provided insights into the key factors influencing house prices in Mumbai, facilitating informed decision-making for real estate stakeholders.
